-- The consultation instantiation tool needs to be checked through.  
How are subsidiary schemes tied to main line propositions?  Is this only in virtue of the SQL queries, which is as it should be.

-- How can I access the results of the consultation?  I've not worked with those queries before.

-- In the online tool at UID, the circumstances digressions are not indented, though it appears that other pages work OK.

-- Looking at the tool online, I see that we never implemented the control issue.  
It is possible for a user to disagree with the default on a radio button, go to a digression, 
then leave all the defaults in the digression alone.  In effect, we have a contradiction since the defaults in the digression 
are the justification for the default in the main line.  Not sure what to say about this issue.  Nothing to do about it now.
